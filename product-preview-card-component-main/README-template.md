The first approach was to create clear, simple and readable HTML.

The second phase was the creation of the CSS, with root, * and body.

The idea started this time in reverse, working from mobile and then on desktop.
I prepared the code exclusively for the cell phone and verified that it worked.
I then integrated the desktop additions.

I have to say that I encountered some difficulties, always working backwards, but it was quite a challenge.
One obstacle I still have to delve into is the @query.
